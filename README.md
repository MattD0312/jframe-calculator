Calculator created in Java using JFrame, first time using JFrame and I thought it was cool

Two different projects created in IntelliJ: Client and Server

Client created using MVC Architecture and various design patterns (split into proper packages)

I want to make the Model class have better methods to act as hooks for the controller to call but I need to stop at some point
Doing this would increase Decoupling more but w/e, I'm sadly too busy

First run Server then run Client if you want to see the equations you calculate printed to the Server's console

I'm hoping the .gitignores in the .idea/ folders are fine as-is
